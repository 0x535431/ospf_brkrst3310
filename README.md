# EVE-NG FORK READ ME
Now you can enjoy Nick Russo's OSPF troubleshooting adventure without having to hook up everything yourself.

The EVE-NG file is _Exports_unetlab_export-20180728-234021.zip

That file has the initial configs only so you can get troubleshooting right away!
Just import that into EVE-NG and away you go, you might have to tweek some IOS version settings...
